1. GENERAL PURPOUSE INSTANCE :
       Provide balence of Memory,Compute and Networking resources can be used in Verity of workloads
       3 type of series 
        a. A-series  b. M-series  c. T-series

       b. M-series ::: is used for large instances  used custom intel xgen E5 Haswell processor optimised Specifically for CE2       Instance
           ➡️ VCPU ->2-40(max);
           ➡️ RAM 8-160 GB RAM 
           ➡️ instance Storgae EBS only
          remaing all M series is ideal cloud  
           ➡️ VCPU ->2-96(max);
           ➡️ RAM 8-382 GB RAM 
           ➡️ instance Storgae EBS and NVMs SSD
       c. T-series ::: T series used for Devlopment pupose testing, at starting phase testing , testing purpose only
           ➡️ VCPU ->2-8(max);
           ➡️ RAM 05-32 GB RAM 
              used for code devlopment , website devlopment,web app ,code reposotories

2. COMPUTE OPTIMISED :::  
       A Compute Optimized Instance is a type of cloud server (VM) designed for high CPU performance relative to   memory and storage. It’s best when your application is CPU-intensive rather than memory- or disk-heavy. 
           ➡️ More CPU power, less RAM & storage
           ➡️ Best for fast processing, calculations, and heavy computation 

           C-series instances
            C5, C6i, C7g
            Example: c6i.large

             -- Common Use Cases --
          ✔ High-performance backend APIs
          ✔ Microservices with heavy computation
          ✔ Gaming servers
          ✔ Batch processing
          ✔ Video encoding / transcoding
          ✔ Machine learning inference
          ✔ Scientific & financial modeling

3. MEMORY OPTIMISED INSTANCE ::: 
      A Memory Optimized Instance is a cloud VM designed for workloads that need very high RAM compared to CPU. It’s ideal when your application keeps large data sets in memory for fast access.  
          ➡️ More RAM, comparatively fewer CPUs
          ➡️ Best for in-memory processing   

          R-series → R5, R6i, R7g
          X-series → X2idn, X2iedn (very large RAM)    

4. STORAGE OPTIMISED INSTANCE :::
     A Storage Optimized Instance is a cloud VM designed for workloads that need very fast disk I/O, high throughput, and/or large local storage. 
          ➡️ High disk performance (IOPS + throughput)
          ➡️ Optimized for read/write–heavy workloads         
            -- Key Points --
          ✔ Very high IOPS
          ✔ High disk throughput
          ✔ Often uses NVMe SSDs
          ✔ Low-latency local storage
          ✔ Suitable for large data volumes

            -- Common Use Cases --
          ✔ Big data processing (Hadoop, Spark)
          ✔ Data warehousing
          ✔ NoSQL databases (Cassandra, MongoDB)
          ✔ Log processing & analytics
          ✔ Search engines (Elasticsearch, OpenSearch)
          ✔ Streaming & ETL pipelines
          ✔ Media processing
        -------------------------------------------
        |                                         |
        |  I-series → i3, i4i (NVMe SSD)          | 
        |  D-series → d3, d3en (high HDD capacity)|
        |                                         |

        :::::::::::::::EC2 Instance ::::::::::::

        It is service that provides resizable virtual server call as instance which used to run application

        => Instance Type : Select thr Hardware capacity(e.g.CPU memory);
        => AMI (Amezon Machine Image):choose the operating system and software (linux,mac,windows).
        => Storage: Configure the type and size of storage
        => Security Groups: Set up firewall rules to control inbound/outbound traffic.
        => Key Pair: Create or use an existing key pair for SSH access.
        =>Network Settings: Configure VPC ,subnet,and assing public or private IP Addresses.
        =>IAM Role: Attach IAM Role Permissions to access other AWS resources.
        =>User Data : Add Script to be exicuted when intance start.
        Elastic IP: Optionally associate a ststic IP addess for consistentpublic access 

       :!:!:!:!:!:!:! Important Points About Security Groups !:!:!:!:!:!:!:!:

        Security Groups are region-specific.
        They support only “Allow” rules (no explicit deny rules).
        By default:==>
        All inbound traffic is blocked
        All outbound traffic is allowed

        You define rules based on:==>

        Protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, etc.)
        Port numbers
        HTTP → Port 80
        HTTPS → Port 443
        SSH → Port 22

        IP addresses or ranges =>
        Example: allow traffic only from a specific IP or CIDR range

        Additional Important Point =>
        When inbound traffic is allowed on a specific port (e.g., port 80 for HTTP), the response (outbound) traffic is automatically allowed, even without an explicit outbound rule.
